sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: already sorted list took much shorted time to sort than the reversed or random list, implying that there is a "best" case scenario for sort 2.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 was remarkably faster comapred to the others when sorting the random file. Also, the time it took to sort sorted list and reversed wasn't too different, implying big O and omega are the same.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: sort3 took roughly the same amount of time to sort random and already sorted list. This is the case for selection sort, not bubble sort.
